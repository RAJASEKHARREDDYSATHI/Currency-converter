Currency Converter
This program, developed in Java by our team (Sathi Raja Sekhar Reddy and Chirla Satya Deleep Reddy), is designed to convert currency values between five different currencies: Indian Rupee, US Dollar, Japanese Yen, British Pound, and Australian Dollar.

How It Works:
The user inputs the source currency, the amount, and the target currency. The program then calculates and outputs the equivalent value in the desired currency based on predefined exchange rates.

Uses:

Useful for travelers to easily convert currencies during international trips.
Assists in understanding currency values and conversions between different countries.
Extension:
This program can be expanded to include additional currencies by adding their exchange rates and conversion logic.

Limitations:
The current implementation uses predefined exchange rates, which may need manual updates to reflect real-time values.
